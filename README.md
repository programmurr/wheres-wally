# Where's Wally?

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app)

*"This project will finally give you a chance to tie together everything you’ve learned so far. You’ll build an app that feels a whole lot like a photo tagging app. You’ll start with a large photograph which contains several elements the user is meant to find, e.g. Waldo, The Wizard, Wilma etc… The user will make selections for each character and they will get feedback on whether they are correct or not."*

*"Keep track of how long it takes between when the photo is first loaded and when the user finally identifies all characters (do this on the server side). Once a round is complete, ask the user for his/her name and record that time. Then show a leaderboard of all the times for people who have played your game!*
